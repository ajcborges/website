# Intro

I am an engineer with extensive experience in the security field, with a strong focus on cloud engineering. I have developed deep expertise in designing, securing, and managing cloud-based environments.

In my current role, I apply hands-on knowledge to ensure the protection and resilience of digital systems across modern cloud architectures. I am passionate about cloud security and continuously stay updated with the latest best practices, emphasizing automation, efficiency, and operational excellence.

Outside of work, I am a HomeLab enthusiast and a passionate [photographer](https://www.instagram.com/ajcborges/), always exploring new ways to experiment with technology and capture the world around me. Cycling fuels my sense of freedom and adventure, while swimming provides a peaceful way to recharge. I am also deeply interested in DevOps, constantly experimenting with new tools and approaches to enhance how we build and manage cloud systems.
